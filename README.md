I made this when I was about 15 or 16, and it was one of my first PHP projects. Basically, you dropped it in a LAMP server, ran the setup script, and you magically had a forum complete with comprehensive admin tools. All data was stored in dynamically-edited text files, not a database. For ease of set-up, this was great, but when too many edits happened or an edit got corrupted, the script vomited your (sometimes private) data all over the place, sometimes ending up in another person's inbox. It was great.
